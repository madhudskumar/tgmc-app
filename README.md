#BIET PREMIER LEAGUE - 8.0
###ABSTRACT

As technology advances, more people are on the internet. Hence, we came up with an idea to bring the college event to people & participants through the web and Android app. The app deals with annual cricket league event hosted by DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, BIET DAVANGERE. Here the details of all teams, fixtures, scores & team-members are displayed to the client. In addition, we have also implemented managed services like administration, client access restriction, security using token access, and HMAC(Hash-based message authentication code) for administrative access.
